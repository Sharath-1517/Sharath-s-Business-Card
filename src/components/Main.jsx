                I am from Chennai, India. I live with my parents, besides my parents I also have a younger brother. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from R.M.D. Engineering College in Chennai in 2024. I embarked on this professional path to become a full stack engineer since I have a strong interest in coding and problem-solving . I've said before that I'm quite interested in competing in coding contests, hackathons, ideathon and learning Linux commands. In addition to being enthusiastic about my job, I also like working with open source by making contributions to them.

                    My personal interests are in learning new skills frequently like I learned React and Sass together recently. Now I'm learning React in depth via projects and live practicing in Scrimba.com where they provide live codespace where we can practice as soon as we complete a tutorial. Learning and developing myself into a professional Java and React.js full-stack is my personal interest.
